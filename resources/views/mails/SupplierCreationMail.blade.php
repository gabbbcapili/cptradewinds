<i>Congratulations!</i> You have taken the first step in making it easier for buyers in the Philippines to find you and do business with you. <br><br>

<p>While it's easy to ship products out of your country, a lot of suppliers are not aware of how excruciatingly difficult and expensive it is for their buyers in the Philippines to get their goods out of customs. This results in an unhappy experience that usually means they won't purchase from you again. 
</p>

<p>This is where we come in. If you partner with us, we'll take care of the entire export and import process. You just have to ship to our warehouse and we'll take care of everything - ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING. Once your shipment has cleared customs, your buyer will just have to pay, pickup, no questions asked. They're happy, and you get a better chance of getting repeat business.</p>
To see the entire process, visit <a href="https://importanything.ph/how-it-works/">importanything.ph/how-it-works</a>

NEXT STEPS: 
	<ul>
		<li>Create a company storefront</li>
		<li>Submit a quotation request</li>
	</ul>
